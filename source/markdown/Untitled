Step 1:
Gravity pulls the ball down accelerating it downward at a constant rate.
It rebounds upward but it loses some energy when it lands, and it has to accelerate upward against gravity. So it starts fast and goes slower as it travels upward.

- Move bottom point to 30 percent.

Step 2:
We need to make the ball accelerate downward and decelerate upward.

- Add cubic bezier easing.

Step 3:
A ball will pause at the top of the arc.

- Add stop point at 85 percent

Step 4:
Ball will pause at the bottom before it rebounds.

- Add stop point at bottom

Step 5:
Ball will flatten at the bottom from the force of the impact.

- Reduce height and increase width between impact and time ball starts arc back up.
- Set back to normal width at 50%

Step 6:
When a ball rebounds, it flexes back in the opposite direction.

- At 50%, set width narrow width and tall height.
